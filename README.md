Final Bioinformatic Project Spring 2024
## THE STUDY BACKGROUND
Data from fish genome sequencing studies conducted in the Great Bay and Wells regions were utilized to perform comprehensive genomic analysis following the methods outlined [the provided link](https://github.com/jthmiller/eDNA-metabarcoding-intro/tree/mifish-intro?tab=readme-ov-file)
The final presentation summarizing the findings of the genomic analysis can be accessed via [the provided link](https://github.com/KwadwoLarbi/joshua-armani-qiayra_final-project). The presentation was created using Marp markdown slides creation tool, providing a visually engaging overview of the results and interpretations. All the code utilized for this project is accessible under the code tabs within the method sections, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the analysis steps. Assembling the genomic data into a coherent narrative allowed for the generation of figures and results that can be shared and discussed within the scientific community, contributing to our understanding of fish biodiversity and informing conservation and management strategies in coastal areas.
